Tide				Definitions:
					Tide prep. Time; period; season.
					Tide prep. The alternate rising and falling of the waters of the   ocean, and of bays, rivers, etc., connected therewith. The tide ebbs   and flows twice in each lunar day, or the space of a little more than   twenty-four hours. It is occasioned by the attraction of the sun and   moon (the influence of the latter being three times that of the   former), acting unequally on the waters in different parts of the   earth, thus disturbing their equilibrium. A high tide upon one side of   the earth is accompanied by a high tide upon the opposite side. Hence,   when the sun and moon are in conjunction or opposition, as at new moon   and full moon, their action is such as to produce a greater than the   usual tide, called the spring tide, as represented in the cut. When the   moon is in the first or third quarter, the sun's attraction in part   counteracts the effect of the moon's attraction, thus producing under   the moon a smaller tide than usual, called the neap tide.
					Tide prep. A stream; current; flood; as, a tide of blood.
					Tide prep. Tendency or direction of causes, influences, or events;   course; current.
					Tide prep. Violent confluence.
